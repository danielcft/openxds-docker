IHE promotes the coordinated use of established standards such as DICOM and HL7 to address specific clinical needs in support of optimal patient care. Systems developed in accordance with IHE standards are better able to communicate with one another and empower care providers to use information more effectively. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ihe.net/" target="_blank">IHE </a>site ( <a href="http://www.ihe.net/">www.ihe.net </a>) for more details. </p></div><p class="h2"><strong>&nbsp;XDS.b </strong>&nbsp; </p><p class="h2">The Cross Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) IHE integration profile facilitates the registration, distribution and access across health enterprises of patient electronic health records. XDS is focussed on providing a standards-based specification for managing the sharing of medical summary documents between any healthcare enterprise, ranging from a private physician office to a clinic to an acute care in-patient facility.&nbsp; </p><p class="h2">The XDS IHE integration profile assumes that these enterprises belong to one or more clinical affinity domains. A clinical affinity domain is a group of healthcare enterprises that have agreed to work together using a common set of policies and share a common infrastructure. An XDS implementation consists of two parts - A Document repository and a registry. </p><ul><li><div class="h2">A Document Repository is responsible for storing documents in a transparent, secure, reliable and persistant manner and responding to document retrieval requests. </div></li><li><div class="h2">A Document Registry is responsible for storing information about these documents so that the documents of interest for the care of a patient may be easily found, selected and retrieved irrespective of the repository where they are actually stored. </div></li></ul><p class="h2">As XDS is document content agnostic, any type&nbsp;of patient clinical information without regard&nbsp;to content and representation is supported. This makes the XDS IHE integration profile equally able to handle documents, containing multiple types of formats including simple text, formatted text (e.g. HL7 CDA), images (e.g. DICOM) or structured and vocabulary coded clinical information (e.g. CDA Release 2, CCD) etc. In order to ensure the necessary interoperability between the document sources and the document consumers, the individual organizations must adopt policies concerning document format, structure and content.&nbsp; </p><p class="h2"><strong>Licensing </strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="h2">OpenXDS&nbsp;libraries are licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache Public License 2.0</a>.
